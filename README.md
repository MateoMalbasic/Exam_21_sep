# Exam_21_sep
Python assignment(https://github.com/MateoMalbasic/Exam_21_sep/blob/master/exam_Sep_21_2018.ipynb)

R assigment, I handed this assignment in in a word file because I could not hand it in via GitHub. Furthermore please read the bottom part of my R assignment!! (https://github.com/MateoMalbasic/Exam_21_sep/upload/master) Further I handed it also in in the file from which I worked in russet.uvt.nl and this looks very weird when I upload it so I uploaded it via Word. The people who observed us in G101 also saw that I made it in a normal notebook but that it came out very weird. (https://github.com/MateoMalbasic/Exam_21_sep/blob/master/exam_2_student2.0.htm)
